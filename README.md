# Mgrler
Mgrler is an addon for World of Warcraft that translates chat text from English into Nerglish, the language of the Murloc race in game. This addon is purely for laughs and giggles and serves no practical purpose otherwise. For more information please see the [Nerglish article](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Nerglish) on Wowpedia.
